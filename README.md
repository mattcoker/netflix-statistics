# Netflix Statistics
Chrome extension for displaying and calculating various statistics from a Netflix profile viewing history

## Installation

- `git clone git@github.com:mattcoker/netflix-statistics.git`
- Visit chrome://extensions/
- Enable the "Developer Mode" checkbox
- Click the "Load Unpacked Extension" button
- Select the folder containing the `manifest.json` for this repository

## Usage

Visit any logged in Netflix URL, and click the icon. It may take a few minutes to collect all of the data if there is a lot of history.

The data displayed is specific to the currently-active profile, so activating this extension while different profiles are active will result in different statistics.
